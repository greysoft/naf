/**
 * An object container which also manufactures objects on demand.
 * <br>
 * This container extends ObjectPile by acting as an object well (or source), not just a passive store. That is,
 * whereas ObjectPile only lets you take out what you put in, this class's extraction operation may result in new objects
 * being created on demand (and will do so, on the first extraction).
 * <br>
 * You should only use its store() methods to return objects which were previously extracted from this well (which also
 * means that they would have been originally created by this well), but beware that it does not enforce this.
 * <br>
 * If no factory is provided, this class auto-creates the stored object elements using their the default constructor.
 * <p>
 * Since objects start off on the well and are expected to be returned to it if and when the caller is done with them,
 * the extract() method effectively hands objects out on loan, while the store() methods return them.
 * <br>
 * When we talk below about the "extant population", we mean the total number of objects in existence, whether currently
 * stored in the well or out on loan.
